    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Homemade wonton soup! These wontons are filled with a juicy pork and prawn / shrimp filling and will knock your socks off</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 bunch green onions, cut into pieces</li>
        <li>6 fresh sliced mushrooms</li>
        <li>1 lb ground pork</li>
        <li>1 egg</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dry bread crumbs</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 package wonton wrappers</li>
        <li>8 cups chicken broth</li>
        <li>1 medium head bok choy, torn into 2 inch pieces</li>
        <li>16 snow peas</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>Dice the green onions, and set aside all but 1 tablespoon. Slice the mushrooms, and set aside all but 1 tablespoon. Finely chop the 1 tablespoon of green onions and 1 tablespoon of sliced mushrooms, and place in a bowl with the ground pork, 1 tablespoon sesame oil, 1 tablespoon soy sauce, egg, bread crumbs, salt, and pepper. Stir to thoroughly mix the pork filling.</li>
        <li>Spoon about 1 tablespoon of the pork filling onto the center of each wonton wrapper. Use your finger or a pastry brush to lightly moisten the edges of the wonton wrappers with water. Fold one corner of the wrapper over the filling onto the opposite corner to form a triangle. Press the edges together to seal. Moisten the two long ends of the triangle, fold them together, and press them firmly to seal.</li>
        <li>Bring the chicken broth to a boil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Drop the wontons, one by one, into the broth, and let them cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until they float to the surface. Reduce heat to a simmer, and gently stir in the shrimp, bok choy, and reserved sliced mushrooms. Let the soup simmer 2 more minutes, until the shrimp turn pink, and then drop in the snow pea pods. Garnish with the remaining green onions and a dash of soy sauce and sesame oil, and serve immediately.</li>
    </ol>
